- **Multi-select filters:** Room, Type  
- **Single-select filters:** Security level  
- **Date range filters**  
- **Export to PDF and XLSX**

---

### 🗂 **Schedule — Timeline View**
A detailed timeline grouped by rooms and ordered by time:

- Mobile-optimized compact schedule
- Desktop timeline visualization

## 🎯 UX/UI Innovations Introduced

### **1) Updated Event Highlight**
Events marked with `"updated": true` receive a visual highlight:
- Amber left-border  
- Amber background  
- Helps users identify schedule changes at a glance

### **2) Search Bar in Meetings**
Users can filter meetings **instantly by title**, improving discoverability in large schedules.

### **3) Table ↔ Card View Toggle**
The Meetings page includes a segmented toggle that allows switching between:
- **Table view** (dense, analytical)
- **Card view** (visual, mobile-friendly)

Both modes fully respect filters and accessibility.

## 📚 Case Study — GrandReserva Redesign

### 1. Context
UNFCCC relies on GrandReserva to coordinate meetings across large climate conferences.  
The original UI had limitations in navigation, readability, and event discovery.

### 2. Objective
Deliver a modernized interface that is:
- more intuitive  
- faster to use  
- more informative  
- more accessible  
- visually aligned with UN brand guidelines  

### 3. Problems Identified
- Hard to find specific meetings  
- Outdated visual layout  
- No search bar  
- No indication of updated events  
- No alternative visual modes  
- Timeline lacked clarity  

### 4. Delivered Solution

#### ✔ Modernized Meetings view  
With filters, search, exports, column hierarchy and toggle view.

#### ✔ New Schedule timeline  
Timeline grouped by rooms, fully ordered and responsive.

#### ✔ Three UX innovations  
1. **Updated event notification**  
2. **Search bar for Meetings**  
3. **Table ↔ Card visualization toggle**

#### ✔ UI consistent with UNFCCC  
Using neutral tones, institutional blue (`#003366`) and clean typography.

#### ✔ Smarter filters  
Sliding/folding sidebar, sticky on desktop, fluid on mobile.
